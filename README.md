## Brief History

The concept of fractals was introduced by mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot in 1974, inspired by the Latin word *fractus*, meaning "broken" or "fractured." Fractals are mathematical objects that display self-similarity at different scales, and their intricate patterns can be found both in abstract mathematics and in nature, such as in Romanesco broccoli or coastlines.

This project, developed as part of the School 42 curriculum, is designed to help students explore the fascinating world of fractals while learning about graphical programming and mathematical concepts like complex numbers. By implementing and visualizing various fractal sets, students gain hands-on experience with algorithms, optimization, and event-driven programming using the miniLibX graphics library.

The term fractal was first used by the mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot.
in 1974, was based on the Latin word fractus, which means “broken” or “fractured.”
A fractal is an object of mathematical abstraction, such as a curve or surface, that retains a similar pattern regardless of scale.
Several natural phenomena such as Romanesco have some of the characteristics of fractals.

## Features
This project consists of multiple fractals:
- Mandelbrot (M)
- Julia (J)
- BurningShip (B)
- Mandelbox (X)

## How to use fract-ol?
```
$> make
$> ./fractol M
$> ./fractol J
$> ./fractol B
$> ./fractol X
```

### The Julia Set can also receive values as input: 
```
$> ./fractol J <number> <i_number>
```

### For all the previous fractals, we can also add a list of predefined colors:
```
$> ./fractol M <color>
$> ./fractol J <color>
$> ./fractol J <number> <i_number> <color>
$> ./fractol B <color>
$> ./fractol X <color>

Colors List:
- White:   FFFFFF
- Black:   000000
- Red:     FF0000
- Green:   00FF00
- Blue:    0000FF
- Yellow:  FFFF00

```

## Controls

- **Zoom:** Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out. The zoom will focus on the point under the mouse cursor, allowing you to explore specific areas of the fractal in detail.

# Extras 
This new project will be an opportunity to get familiar with miniLibX (complex function library provided by school 42).
In addition, it will be essential for us to know and apply the mathematical notion of complex numbers and let's take a look
to the concept of CGI optimization and event management.
